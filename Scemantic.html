            <h3>Semantic Definition</h3>
            <article>
                Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in
                web pages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is
                processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its
                presentation to human users.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <article>
                In cases where a document requires more precise semantics than those expressed in HTML alone, fragments
                of the document may be enclosed within span or div elements with meaningful class names and , Where
                these class names are also a fragment
                identifier
                within a schema or ontology, they may link to a more defined meaning. Microformats formalise
                this approach to semantics in HTML.

            <article>
                One important restriction of this approach is that such markup based on element inclusion must meet the
                well-formedness conditions. As these documents are broadly tree-structured, this means that only
                balanced fragments from a sub-tree can be marked up in this way.[11][12] A means of marking-up any
                arbitrary section of HTML would require a mechanism independent of the markup structure itself, such as
                XPointer.

            <h3>Something more</h3>
            <article>
                Good semantic HTML also improves the accessibility of web documents (see also Web Content Accessibility
                Guidelines).[citation needed] For example, when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain
                the structure of a document, it will not waste the visually impaired user's time by reading out repeated
                or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly.

            <h3>Last Information</h3>
            <article>
                In 2010, Google specified three forms of structured metadata that their systems will use to find
                structured semantic content within webpages. Such information, when related to reviews, people profiles,
                business listings, and events will be used by Google to enhance the "snippet", or short piece of quoted
                text that is shown when the page appears in search listings. Google specifies that that data may be
                given using microdata, microformats or RDFa.[13] Microdata is specified inside itemtype and itemprop
                attributes added to existing HTML elements; microformat keywords are added inside class attributes as
                discussed above; and RDFa relies on rel, typeof and property attributes added to existing elements.[14]
